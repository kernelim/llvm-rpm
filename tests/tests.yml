      # There is a bug in the build process when it runs out of disk space
      # while stripping binaries, which causes the strip to fail, but does
      # not fail the build.  This results in a libLLVM.so that is over 2GB
      # which breaks the nightly compose.  So this test checks that libLLVM.so
      # is less than 100MB to ensure it was successfully stripped.
