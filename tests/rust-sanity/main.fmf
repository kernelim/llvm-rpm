summary: Test basic cargo usage
test: ./test.sh
require:
# Required for rust and possibly other dependant packages
#
# NOTE #1: drop the requirement once the transitional period between releases is gone
# and llvm-compat is no longer a) needed, and b) part of the build.
#
# NOTE #2: keep it the first requirement. Depending on the order of requirements, placing it somewhere
# else in the list may lead to harness uninstalling and re-installing LLVM packages. That a) would be
# a waste of time, b) could potentially hide issues, leading to testing unexpected NVRs.
